# Lessons learned and what's next

This project has been a success: we managed to create a one-of-a-kind dataset of second-hand fashion items that should have lasting value. Below, I list some challenges we encountered and some future directions for projects in this domain. 

## Challenges

**Data quality issues**: 

1. Only image level annotations are included in the dataset, which means that bounding boxes or segmentation masks necessary for damage detection are not included. 
2. Annotation quality was poor and inconsistent, requiring excessive effort to clean and reject bad annotations. 
3. Higher resolution and better lighting conditions would have made the task easier. 
4. The industry has not settled on a standard for annotating various attributes of fashion items, which makes it challenging to use and finetune pretrained models on the dataset. 

**Organizational challenges**:

1. All partners need a baseline level of technical expertise/support. Occasionally, the laptop or the camera setup did not work as expected and the organizations we were working with were not able to resolve these issues themselves. 
2. Financing problems: The second-hand fashion industry is highly fragmented and under funded, which means that it is difficult for organizations both at an individual level and at a community level to develop and scale up projects.
3. The managers and representatives from organizations did not understand the challenges of AI and automation, making it difficult to implement the projects effectively. 

## Future directions

A few general recommendations:

1. Focus on specialized tasks: Identify niche areas where AI can add the most value, such as damage detection or quality assessment.
2. Adaptability: The field of AI is moving at an unprecedented speed and with the cycles of 6-12 months from going from idea to consortium building to proposal submission to launch, it is essential to be able to adapt to the latest developments. 
3. Transfer of tech: Do not solve an already solved problem; hire technical experts to learn existing tech.
4. Higher quality data: Prioritize the collection of high-resolution images and robust annotations.

**Example future project: Localized Trends** 

1. Emphasize the difficulty in matching supply with local preferences, as trends can vary significantly.​ 
2. Collect data from first-hand retailers, ensuring representativeness and timeliness.
3. Build a dataset of local trends, including information on the number of items sold, the prices, and the availability of the items.
4. End to end digitalization: For AI models that can adapt to changing trends and preferences dynamically, everything needs to be digital.​

**Example future project: Recycling/Material detection**

The grand challenge in recycling is to identify the materials of garments to a high degree of accuracy, which is particularly difficult for multi-layered garments and garments with certain colors. 

1. Raw sensor data: For AI to accurately identify materials to streamline recycling processes, we need raw data.​ 
2. Differentiating recycling from reuse: Hard problem – need demand modeling in recycling and retail sectors to decide whether to recycle or reuse. 
3. Lifecycle Tracking: Develop systems to track garments throughout their lifecycle, optimizing decisions on whether to recycle, repair, or resell.​ 
4. Innovative Recycling Methods: Encourage research into new recycling technologies that can handle a wider range of materials, enabled by better material detection.​
